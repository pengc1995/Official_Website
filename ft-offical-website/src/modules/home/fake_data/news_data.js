        'content': '<span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: &quot;OpenSans&quot;; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">On November 29, 2019, the Young Elite Vancouver Business Association successfully hosted the ASPAC YE 2019 annual dinner in Vancouver. On the evening of the party, the Vancouver Young Youth Association presented awards to Vancouver’s Outstanding Young Start-ups and Outstanding Young Entrepreneurs. The Vancouver Youth League aims to build a stage for young Vancouver entrepreneurs. More than 300 local young talents gathered in Vancouver to celebrate their growth and share their achievements over the past year with the purpose of learning, making friends, mutual encouragement and development.</span><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: &quot;OpenSans&quot;; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: &quot;OpenSans&quot;; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Yaofei Feng, the CTO of Fantuan, was invited to accept the “YE Young Industry Leader” award, on behalf of Fantuan, and share his personal entrepreneurial experience, along with Fantuan’s development process with the guests of this event. This award reflects the Chinese community in Vancouver’s recognition of Fantuan as the leading Chinese entrepreneurial company in Vancouver. Since its establishment in 2014, Fantuan has dug deep into the technological life-services industry and is continuing to innovate and meet the needs of consumers and businesses. The company has also been actively giving back to the community for a long time, providing overseas youth with a platform for career development in the internet industry.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: &quot;OpenSans&quot;; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: &quot;OpenSans&quot;; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The award was created by the Vancouver Youth League in 2017. Every year in Vancouver, about 30 representatives, people or businesses from various industries are included in the candidate list. “YE Young Industry Leader” not only requires the nominated company to have a widely recognized performance and social responsibility, but also requires the candidate to have a bold vision and unique understanding and judgment of the world’s macro-structures. Those who have been selected as “YE Young Industry Leaders” need to actively serve various industries in Vancouver, have an innovative spirit and actively contribute to help create a brighter future for the local community in Vancouver.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: &quot;OpenSans&quot;; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span class="ql-cursor"></span></span></p>',
